* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -5° to +5° horizontally and -5° to +5° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random shear of between -5° to +5° horizontally and -5° to +5° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
